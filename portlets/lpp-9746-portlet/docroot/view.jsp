Hi Adorján,

Please add code here to control "NewPortlet" in the following way.

* Add a button, named "Start" which should appear only if there isn't any data
generation is progress. This button should trigger NewPortlet#processAction().

* Add another button, named "Refresh" which informs the user about the progress;
NewPortlet#serveResource() will give you info about the current status.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Cheers,
Laci
